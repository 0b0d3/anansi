# ANANSI - Adaptive Neuromorphic Anomaly Network for Systemic Infiltration

> "The spider that weaves reality itself"

## ⚠️ WARNING

ANANSI is an experimental, highly aggressive security system designed for critical infrastructure protection. It employs reality manipulation, deception, and adaptive defense mechanisms that can make systems difficult to analyze or debug.

**USE ONLY ON AUTHORIZED SYSTEMS WITH PROPER AUTHORIZATION**

## Overview
> ⚠️ **Status: 70% Complete — active development ongoing.**

ANANSI is a revolutionary Linux security system that doesn't just defend—it actively warps an attacker's perception of reality. Built on principles of quantum uncertainty and evolutionary adaptation, ANANSI creates a malleable computational environment where observation changes the observed.

### Key Features

- **Reality Engine**: Multiple simultaneous system states, each observer sees different reality
- **Phantom Processes**: Processes that appear real but exist only as illusions
- **Memory Mirrors**: Deceptive memory regions that trap and mislead malware
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Defenses that literally evolve based on attack patterns
- **Quantum Uncertainty**: System behavior becomes unpredictable under observation
- **Scorched Earth Protocol**: Nuclear option that makes system unusable for attackers

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Linux kernel 5.0+ (for eBPF support)
- Rust 1.70+
- Root privileges
- 64-bit x86_64 architecture

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anonymous/anansi
cd anansi

# Run installation script
sudo ./scripts/install.sh

# Start ANANSI
sudo systemctl start anansi
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run basic tests
sudo anansi test

# Run full test suite
sudo anansi test --mode full

# Test specific components
sudo anansi test --mode phantom    # Test phantom processes
sudo anansi test --mode reality    # Test reality manipulation
```

## Usage

### Starting ANANSI

```bash
# Start in daemon mode
sudo anansi start

# Start with custom config
sudo anansi start --config /path/to/config.toml
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check status
sudo anansi status

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u anansi -f
```

### Emergency Shutdown

```bash
# Normal shutdown
sudo anansi kill

# Force shutdown (scorched earth)
sudo anansi kill --force
```

## Configuration

Edit `/etc/anansi/anansi.toml`:

```toml
paranoia_level = 0.8          # 0.0-1.0, higher = more aggressive
reality_flux_rate = 0.5       # How often reality changes
mutation_rate = 0.3           # Defense evolution speed
illusion_density = 0.6        # % of system that's fake
entropy_threshold = 0.7       # Chaos level threshold
```

## Architecture

```
ANANSI Core
├── Reality Engine (multiple system states)
├── Quantum State Manager (superposition)
├── Entropy Harvester (chaos collection)
├── Defense Engine
│   ├── Observer Detection
│   ├── Attack Analysis
│   └── Mutation Engine
├── Deception Engine
│   ├── Phantom Processes
│   ├── Memory Mirrors
│   └── Vulnerability Traps
└── Kernel Interface
    ├── eBPF Programs
    └── Kernel Module
```

## How It Works

1. **Observer Detection**: ANANSI constantly monitors for debuggers, tracers, scanners
2. **Reality Forking**: Each observer is shown a different, internally consistent reality
3. **Adaptive Response**: System evolves defenses based on attack patterns
4. **Deception Layers**: Multiple layers of illusions confuse and misdirect
5. **Quantum Collapse**: Observation fundamentally changes system behavior

## Security Considerations

- ANANSI can make systems difficult to debug or analyze
- False positives may affect legitimate system administration
- Scorched earth mode can impact system availability
- Not recommended for development environments

## Troubleshooting

### ANANSI won't start
- Check you have root privileges
- Verify kernel version (5.0+)
- Check logs: `journalctl -u anansi`

### High CPU usage
- Normal during active attacks
- Adjust `paranoia_level` in config
- Check for phantom process leaks

### Can't uninstall
- Use emergency kill: `sudo anansi kill --force`
- Manually remove: `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/anansi`
- Clean kernel module: `sudo rmmod anansi_kmod`
